# Non-ordinary-state-based-peridynamic-NOSBPD-for-2D-fracture-problem

This program is about Non-ordinary-state-based-peridynamic(NOSBPD).

This simple code is perfect for beginners in the field of peridynamics.

Codes is rewritten from project of @Ji Wan("Stabilized_Peridynamics_Code,https://github.com/whuwanji/Stabilized_Peridynamics_Code").

This code simulates a 2D crack propagation problem.

Last I hope this code can help you learn PD better, and if you have any questions about PD, you can discuss them with me by my researchgate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jin-Hu-Pan
